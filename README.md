# Police-brutality-analysis-2018
Cases of police brutality are a sad reality for every country.Police brutality is a worldwide phenomenon including racial abuse for centuries in the USA, Britain, and continental European countries where protests have been dealt with brutal force.The developing world is infamous for police excesses during protests or otherwise.
In India too, police forces are infamous for “Third degree”, custodial deaths, inactivity due to excessive political subordination.
This is a serios cause for concern. Here, we have analyzed data relating to police brutality cases and have put together some rather interesting insights.
The dashboard looks like this 
![Dashboard 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49113730/195125079-885945bc-850a-4d15-af83-23346e5c60e6.png)


The first chart compares the no of cases registered and the no of plice personel convicted across diferent states and we observe that in the state of rajasthan a whooping no of 3340 cases were registered and only one police personnel was convicted.

The second analysis shows us the no of police personel convicted across different states and we can clearly see that Madhya Pradesh has the maximum no of convictions which reflects fair judgement.

The third graph plotted is no of cases registered vs no of cases withdrawn across different states. We notice that no of cases withdrawn for Bihar is maximum which explains the bad raport state police has in Bihar whereas 0 cases were withdrawn in Rajasthan.

The fourth plottaion explain the distribution of the no of police personel arrested vs no of trials completed. The largest size of Maharashtra state explains that the state has a maximum no of arrests and the darkest colour of the state of Madhya Pradesh suggests that no of trials completed are maximum.

This next butterfly graph compares the no of personel arrested with the no of personel acquitted or discharged and it clearly tells us that states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have maximum rate of discharge whereas state of Maharashtra has maximum no of arrets.

In the final chart we analyse no of cases registered and no of cases chargesheeted in side by side bar graph and realise that there is a huge difference for the state of Rajasthan.
